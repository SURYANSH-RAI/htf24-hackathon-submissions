This project is basically a bunmch of HTML based website which i created for poor childern of government school under the initiative of 
AatmaNirbharBharat just to help them since they don't have labs at many schools but now government proivided them tablets/smartphones.

Basically, i this project i have made virtual labs on the basis of my readings of 12th for some basic expriments of physics of 10th standard,
were children will get to know how to perform experiments, about laws and videos and animations related to that experiment and lastly they
will have a quiz section to test their understanding. I want to continue this project so i will be adding more and more exeriments.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
_What is the story behind this project? Why did you choose to work on this specific idea?_


The reason I chose this idea/project was one day i was experimenting with my electronics project in feild, a boy came to me and told me to
help him by providing some wire, a cell, some resistors and my multimeter for sometime so that he can perform Ohm's law. after a long conversation,
the point was government provided them tablets/smatphone but their schools was not having labs or such facilites to perform expriments.
So, i decided not just to help him but others too .
